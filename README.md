# Resume-FirstProject
First project to practice (February 2021)

First project to start building a resume.

I'm done with tutorials, everyday training to learn new programming leanguages, so I decided to start my own projects. The idea is to build many projects as posible, starting with easy ones and eventually try to build more complex ones.
Also, as you might already noticed, is that I will try to write everything in english, so I can practice my writing (is much more difficult to write than speak imo) 

So, this is a peculiar README file, cause I'm telling you all of this instead of explaining what is this project about. But this is already the project, which is get better at programming doing practice, instead of only listening to courses and tutorials.

The majority of the things that I want to lear are not teached in my university, things like Javascript, NeoVIM, React, NodeJs, Angular, Git and Python, so I will build lots of repositories in GitHub with differents projects working with this technologies.

So, let's start

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I said, I'll start with something easy, and start climbing 'till I can build more complex projects.
This first one is going to be pure HTML and CSS, in a single page, so this is going to be a static "landing page", with no forms, no logins, no database, no navegation around pages and no backend (I mean, no Js, no C#, no Python, etc.)
The theme of this webpage will be me. It will show information about things I like, things I do and other things.
