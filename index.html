                            My name is Nahuel Fedyszyn Issa. I was born in 1996 in Salta, Argentina, the first child born of my family generation, so both families (my dad's family and my mom's family) where obsessed with me. Not cool at all, it was a really pain in the a**, until my cousins came to the world and my brother, in 2000.

                        <p>
                            My interest in technology started pretty soon. There are photos of me playing videogames when I was 3 years old, and when I growed up, I started to have interest in things like videogames, computers, and programs. Of course, a child like me wasn't thinking of build that things, I just used them when my parents let me do it.

                        <P>
                            When I was in high school, I started to save for my first computer. In my family, my dad teach us (me and my brother) that if you want something, you have to work; you have to earn it, so I started to ask my aprents if they can give me a job. We don't have a family bussiness, but my dad had a good job, so they gave me home jobs (we used to live in a house with a big land so jobs where related to gardening) and, coin by coin, I saved enough for my first computer.

                            It was an Intel Celeron, with 2 GB RAM DDR2 and Windows 7. The price was $2000 (aroun 22 USD today in 2021), and I decided that I wanted to work with something related to computers when I grow up. Of course, I was like 11 or 12 years old, so I didn't imagine the thinks that I can do to work with computers.

                            No more highschool

                            When I was around 15, I decided that I'll be a software engineer. I loved computers and I was pretty good at maths, so the choice was easy. I graduated from the highschool in the year 2014, with honors for my grades and I never came back to that I place (I really hated highschool). The next year I started my carrer at software engineering in the university Universidad Catolica de Salta. I was really excited to start my degree study, but I had other problems, in my house.

                            I was like the black sheep in my house. My interest where (and are) very different to my parents ones. I have other thoughts, other ideals, and other objectives in my life, so living in my parents house was a problem because I wasn't happy at all. It was exhausting to live in that house, at the point that I didn't want anything from my parents; I didn't want them to feed me, to pay the electricity for my stuff, to buy my clothes and that become a problem. I felt the need to escape that place.

                            When I started my degree study, I saw the schedule from all years (my carrer is five years long) and saw that in the 3rd year, all my morning will be free from courses, so I decided that when I reach that year, I'll find a job and leave my parents house
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And I did. At my 20s, I obtained a part-time job in a architecture studio as an assistant, and with the money I payed the rent, the food and the services. I was unable to afford my studies, so my parents keep paying for my university (here in Argentina, is not as expensive as in other first world countries), and I started to live by my own. Of course having a job impacted negatively in my carrer; I did't have too much time to study, and I began to lose time, leaving me where I am right now.

                            Today, I'm facing psychological problems with my psychologist, and gaining my motivation again, so I can leave behind the things that were making me miserable and began to study and practicing programming again. The HTML file that you are reading right now, is the beginning of this process of practicing and learning.

                            So now, you understand whats the purpose of this. Well, that and that I'm trying to improve my english skills (sorry for my bad english)

                This is a pretty shi**y page, but you need to understand, this is my first try. I know hot to put buttons, how to use hyperlinks, but I wanted to build using only the skeleton of a webpage and using a basic css. I did this in a couple hours and I expect to improve my time (in reality, most of the time was spend in the text)            </p>
